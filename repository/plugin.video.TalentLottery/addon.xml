Welcome to The Talent Lottery add-on! The only one of its kind where any aspiring [COLOR = yellow](fill in the blank)[/COLOR] can advertise their talent here for free, and possibly win their very own add-on! More importantly, this add-on will give the artist the opportunity to win the greatest prize of all, being discovered by professionals in the field they are pursuing! Talent Agents take notice!

Aspiring artists must have their "talent" displayed on Youtube so that they can be seen via this add-on. The initial launch of Talent Lottery has the following randomly chosen artists... an aspiring singer/songwriter, a filmmaker and a makeup artist. All future artists will be chosen by you the viewer!

Nominate your friend, relative, co-worker or even a stranger that you think deserves to be seen by a NEW audience! 

Send your nomination to:
* [COLOR = blue]the.knife.repo@yandex.com[/COLOR],
* subject “NOMINATE” in CAPS,
* copy/paste the Youtube channel, playlist or Youtube user ID. 

[COLOR = orange]You only need to send the nominations once, they will be kept on file for future consideration. Information on each month’s contestants can be found in the changelog. A vote will take place annually to determine the winner of their own add-on. Only candidates who post content at least once per week will be eligible to win their own add-on created by “The Knife”. Good luck![/COLOR]
